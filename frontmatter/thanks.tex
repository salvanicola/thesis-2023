\newthought{First}, I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Eleonora Losiouk, who helped me write this thesis and assisted me during the development of the project. \\
I also must thank Kuama, the hosting company, and the tutor, who gave me all the tools and knowledge to implement such a project. \\
Finally, I would like to thank, my University mate, Alessandro Sgreva, without which I couldn't overcome most of the challenges we faced during the courses projects; and my friends and family, that supported me during all these years and eventually allows to achieve this important goal.
