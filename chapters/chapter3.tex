\chapter{Nuki study case}
\label{cap:three}

\newthought{Nuki is an Austrian company}, which design and distribute smart-lock solutions for smart homes and offices. We decided to analyze the Nuki smart-locks first, mainly because there was the immediate availability of these devices and, second, for their security and ease of use. Moreover, Nuki follows an open software integration philosophy and has a large community supporting its forum and blog. 
\\ The main characteristic of their devices is the lack of replacement parts for your existing "analog" lock. Smart locks are designed to work with the already installed door key and deadbolt, with only a few steps to mount and unmount the device. 
\\ They already offer support for many of the vacation rental management systems, integrating smart-lock functionality with reservation information. Moreover, they grant support to third-party developers to integrate their system, with many options like their \acrshort{rest} API.

\section{Nuki components}
\label{sec:nukicomponents}
Nuki offers different configurations to its customers. For the project, we used two of their products: the smart-lock and the bridge. 

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{0.41\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth, frame]{figures/nuki-3-pro-lock.jpg}
    \caption{The smart-lock parts and the mounting system.}
    \label{fig:nuki-smart-lock}
\end{wrapfigure}

The main characteristic of a Nuki smart-lock is the implementation of a small electric drive, which is capable of turning the key inside the deadbolt (fig. \ref{fig:nuki-smart-lock}). The device can be mounted inside the house, making it physically inaccessible from the outside. Moreover, its structure depends only on the shape of the key, for which a few adapters are provided. As such, it is compatible with almost any double cylinder lock.
\\ The user can interact with the button placed on the device to lock and unlock the door, but only from the inside of the house. Moreover, the device still allows for the use of the physical key from outside the building, which is particularly useful in case of emergency. 
\\ This type of smart-lock can work standalone with the Device-Gateway-Cloud architecture described in section \ref{sec:dgcsmartlocks}. The device uses Bluetooth Low Energy (\acrshort{ble} 5) to pair and communicate with an ad-hoc mobile application, available for Android and iOS. This allows the user to connect in the limited Bluetooth range. As such, if we want to interact with the smart-lock remotely, we have to buy a bridge. \\

\begin{wrapfigure}{i}{0.41\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth, frame]{figures/Nuki-Serratura-Intelligente-4.jpg}
    \caption{A Nuki bridge.}
    \label{fig:nuki-bridge}
\end{wrapfigure}

A Nuki bridge connects the smart-lock to the home Wi-Fi network, letting the device access the Internet. The bridge uses two protocols: a \acrshort{ble} module, which interacts with the smart lock, and \acrshort{ieee} 802.11 to communicate with the home modem. The choice of using separate solutions allows the smart lock device to prevent batteries from draining due to the power consumption of the Wi-Fi module. In fact, to work, the bridge must be connected to an electric outlet, within range of the smart lock. \\
There are other products that allow interaction with the smart-lock, which are the keypad and a clicker, called the fob, to replace the mobile application. Moreover, provides an opener to integrate with the home intercom and door sensors, which are not subject of this thesis.

\section{Nuki smart-lock configurations}
The out-of-the-box configuration of the smart-lock involves only the device and a smartphone. The application on the smartphone performs a pairing with the smart-lock, creating (but not exchanging) the key used to communicate. Then, the mobile application acts as a gateway, because the smart-lock is not directly connected to the Nuki server (fig. \ref{fig:dgcnuki}). All the information and the state of the smart-lock are gather and sent to the cloud by the smartphone. 
\begin{figure}[ht]

     \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Two different configuration for the Nuki devices.}
    \label{fig:nukiconf}
\end{figure}
\\ In the second figure \ref{fig:nukibridgedconf}, we can see that the bridge replaces the smartphone and connects the smart-lock directly to the server. If the bridge is available, not all the operations, launched from the smartphone, pass through the server. Opening and closing actions, for instance, act as in the Device-Gateway-Cloud configuration, if the device is in Bluetooth range. However, immediately after this operation the smart-lock is able to update its state on the server, contributing to maintain a consistent state. 
\\ The two wireless technologies involved are Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. 
\subsection{Nuki Bluetooth protocol}
As we mentioned in section \ref{sec:nukicomponents}, the Nuki smart-lock uses \acrshort{ble} 5 to communicate with the smart-lock and the bridge. To achieve low power data transfer, the technology uses a protocol named the Attribute Profile (ATT)\cite{s21113812}. This protocol is responsible for storing data in the form of tables. The fields of this table are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a nonce, which identify an handler,
    \item an attribute type, which is defined by an \gls{uuid},
    \item the read/write permission,
    \item the attribute value.
\end{itemize}
Using the ATT protocol, \acrshort{ble} 5 uses the General Attribute Profile (GATT), which is an abstraction layer that allows communication in a client(the smartphone)-server(the smart-lock) architecture. This protocol, combined with advertising and a caching system, permits BLE to reach low power consumption, comparable with the Zigbee's performance.
\\ The protocol developed by Nuki to exchange data uses the following message format (table \ref{tab:encr-messages}). 

\begin{table}[ht]
    \footnotesize
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{ ADATA } & \multicolumn{4}{c|}{ PDATA } \\
        \hline nonce & authorization id & message length & authorization id & command id & payload & CRC \\
        \hline 24 Byte & 4 Byte & 2 Byte & 4 Byte & 2 Byte & n Byte & 2 Byte \\
        \hline unencrypted & unencrypted & unencrypted & \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{ encrypted } \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Transfer format for encrypted BLE messages}
    \label{tab:encr-messages}
\end{table}

As we can see from the table, the protocol information is in the ADATA section which is not encrypted. Moreover, in the PDATA, we can find the attribute value with a command identifier and the payload, which are encrypted. \\

    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}\vspace*{-\baselineskip}
\end{quotation}\vspace*{-\baselineskip}
As we can see, from the above example, the communication flow goes through different key exchanges. In fact, Nuki has created a custom encryption protocol to have complete control over the security of its devices. A focus on Bluetooth communication security and an in-depth description of the protocol choices will be carried out in section \ref{sec:nuki-sec}.

\section{Nuki application}
The mobile application is an essential component within the Nuki system, because it allows the user to access the available features and manage the smart lock configuration. In order to start using the application, it is needed, of course, an identity for the system; as such, the user must log in or sign up with a Nuki account. After that, it is possible to configure the smart-lock for the first time, which gives the configuring user a key with special permissions, which grants the ability to modify all the settings, see the activity log, and all the status information. Moreover, the application gives the possibility to invite new users to only the owner account. It is possible to delegate these permissions to another account.
\\ When an invitation has been created (fig. \ref{fig:keynukiapp}), the invited receives an email asking you to install the app and create an account. Then, in the email, there is a one-time link that redirects to the application and launches the key creation process. The first time the key is used with the smart-lock the device will be paired to the device. When the new user owns the access permission, it is possible to see the current status of the smart-lock (lock, unlock, uncalibrated, etc.). (fig. \ref{fig:unlocknukiapp}) or, with a swipe up, to use the actions available (fig. \ref{fig:actionukiapp}).

    \label{fig:nukiapp}
\end{figure}

The application is available for both Android and iOS and even for smartwatch OSs. The developers make available an URL scheme to interact with it from other applications. Through the OS intent system, it is possible to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item jump to a specific smart-lock by name or ID and opens the available actions, as in figure \ref{fig:actionukiapp};
    \item open the invite code page with a specific invite code (needed by the invitation link in the email);
    \item delete a specific smart-lock by id, from the list.
\end{itemize}

Another important application in the Nuki ecosystem is the Web portal, called Nuki Web. This is available only if the smart-lock is connected to the Internet with a bridge. From there it is possible to manage the device, see the logs, the status, and manage the users. Moreover, from here it is possible to connect with a short-term rental account (a vacation rental management system) and manage the integration with third party options. In the section "API", there is the possibility to retrieve the client ID, assigned to the account, or to generate \acrshort{api} token, in order to authenticate with the Nuki \acrshort{rest} API.

\section{Security and encryption}
\label{sec:nuki-sec}
One of the strengths of the Nuki smart-lock is the focus on security, with which they have designed their products. To ensure a high degree of security, they had designed a protocol over Bluetooth connections. In particular, they ensure strong end-to-end encryption and resistance to "replay attacks"\cite{encryption_2015}.
\subsection{End-to-end encryption}
Every Nuki application uses its own key to communicate with the smart-lock. Nobody else than your device and your mobile application knows that key. In particular, every message exchanged that runs through the Bluetooth channel is not readable without that key. Encryption is performed with a state-of-the-art algorithm, which is a combination between salsa20\cite{bernstein2005salsa20} and poly1305\cite{procter2014security}, thanks to the NaCl cryptography utility library.
Even in a configuration with a bridge all the data are safe, because they are all encrypted on the source and decrypted on the receiver.
\\ In order to secure the key use for decryption the protocol uses a so called Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange mechanism. This allows the device and the application to create a secret key, known by both sides, without exchanging the key itself.
% posso aggiungere la descrizione di Diffie-Hellman
\\ Finally, the key are saved on both devices; however, as we mentioned in section \ref{sec:smartlockvulnerabilities}, the XML of the application, where the key is probably stored, is accessible if the smartphone is rooted or jailbreaked. 

\subsection{The challenge on response}
In order to avoid the "replay attack", the protocol implements a challenge on the response of every message. The "replay attack" consists of a channel sniffer that can record all bytes during Bluetooth communication. If a malicious application resends the exact byte stream to the smart-lock, it possibly can retrieve the same result. In particular, the attack can be conducted as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item a sniffer records the exact bytes the owner application sent to unlock a device;
    \item those bytes are sent again by a malicious entity;
    \item the smart-lock recognizes those bytes as valid and repeats the action.
\end{itemize}
However, the Nuki smart-lock implements a challenge to secure this malicious behavior. Before the application can send any requests, it receives from the smart-lock a 32 byte random number, which must be sent again with the request. If another command with the same number is received, the smart-lock recognizes the request as invalid and it answers to the malicious application with an unsuccessful response.\cite{10.1007/978-3-031-21333-5_98}

\section{Nuki web API and Webhooks}
Nuki offers \acrshort{rest} \acrshort{api} to developers who want to integrate their services with the smart-lock features. In order to work, the smart-lock must be connected to internet and accessible remotely. As such, it must be in the bridged configuration.
\\ Moreover, the system needs to activate the Nuki web API from the dedicated portal. Once done, it is possible to use the client ID and apply the client secret for OAuth2 authentication. Furthermore, there is the possibility of creating and deleting API tokens.

\subsection{Security}
The API transmits all commands directly through a permanent \acrshort{http}S/\acrshort{tls} connection to the corresponding Nuki bridge, which transmits them via Bluetooth to the Smart Lock for execution\cite{nukiapidocs}. \\
When the Nuki Web API is initialized for the first time, the system creates a server-stored Nuki Web Authentication Key, which gives you the ability to execute commands on all devices associated with the account and connected to the Internet. \\
Thanks to its own Authentication Key, Nuki Web acts independently from the other clients (e.g. Nuki iOS or Android App). 
\\ Despite the fact that the communication between the Nuki server and the bridge is encrypted end-to-end, the one between the APIs and the external client relies only on TLS security.

\subsection{Authentication}
The Nuki REST APIs use bearer authentication, which is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves the usage of a security token called bearer. To avoid receiving an unauthorized response, the commands to the API must contain this token to be performed as in the following example:

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines, caption={Simple curl command towards the Nuki web API with bearer token.}, style=curl]
    curl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer c2c0981ffcab78eecd13c8b7ae9fdec4706045bdbb17b1ef06a335
        b832f36641322c5c3357b7fe47' 
    'https://api.nuki.io/smartlock'
\end{lstlisting}

As such, the client must obtain the token to perform the request to the REST API. There are different methods to retrieve this information.
\subsubsection{API tokens}
From the Nuki web portal it is possible to initialize API integration services. Moreover, it can be generated as a permanent API token, with different levels of permission. This is particularly useful if a smart-lock owner wants to build its own application, or if a developer wants to have a fast way to access the API.
\\ Once the key has been generated, it must be saved, because it only shows once. Additionally, from the portal, it is possible to edit the permission or delete a target API token.

\subsubsection{OAuth2 authentication}
For third-party applications that want to integrate APIs, it is suggested to use the OAuth2 authentication flow. This is particularly useful when there are three actors, the owner of the smart-lock, the third-party client application and the REST API, which must authenticate to each other with a central entity. In particular, the user delegates the authentication to a service that is hosting the user account (Nuki web), authorizing a third-party application to access to the user account permissions.
\\ To achieve that, the external application must be recognized as trustworthy by the REST API. In fact, the developer of the application must apply to receive a client secret from the Nuki web portal, which identify the client. In the Nuki case, this is called "Advanced Nuki API integration", which gives to the account the possibility to use the webhooks. 
\\ However, in general, there are two different types of OAuth2 authentication flows: the "code flow" and the "implicit". In the "implicit" method, there is no need for the client secret, but the bearer token received at the end of the process lasts only for an hour. Transactions proceed as follows.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The client of the third-party application starts the authentication request, stating its client ID (a unique identifier), the permissions that want to exploit and finally a redirect URL, which represents an endpoint of the application which can be called.
    \item The OAuth2 service opens the authentication page (in our case, the authentication of the Nuki web) for the user, declaring the permission he is giving to the external application.
    \item If authentication is successful, the server calls the redirect URL provided in the first request with the token as parameter.
    \item The application then has a bearer token which can be used for one hour.
\end{itemize}

The "code flow" method gives, as output, a valid API token and a refresh token, which can be used after the other token is expired, in order to retrieve a new valid token. However, the process required few steps more and the client secret to be completed.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The first two steps remain the same as in the implicit method, of course specifying the type of transaction it is requesting.
    \item In this case, the server returns a code, which is not the API token, and it has to be used to perform another request, adding client secret as parameter.
    \item The response to the second request contains the actual bearer token, with its expiration time, and the refresh token.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Advanced API integration and webhooks}
The "advanced API integration" is a Nuki program, to which a user must be applied to retrieve a client secret. Furthermore, it will give access to additional API endpoints to manage webhooks. Webhooks are an event system that is used to asynchronously inform about any changes in the device in a timely manner\cite{nukiwebhooksdocs}. Even in this case, there are two possible workflows.
\\ The central webhook workflow forwards all events to a single URL endpoint (fig. \ref{fig:centralwebhook}), whereas the decentral one can manage more than one URL (fig. \ref{fig:decentralwebhook}).

\section{Smart vacation rental Nuki solution}
Nuki has already created a solution to the problem highlighted in the introduction of this document. A vacation rental management system host can install the smart-lock and the bridge in its property and then link the Nuki web account to the whatever platform account they are using as a vacation rental management system. The Nuki is able to check the reservation and automatically send the invitation code to the guests. After their stay, the invitation code is disabled. 
\\ This brings more than one advantage: check-in and check-out can be done 24/7, without human interaction; the service providers and cleaning staff can access and be issued at any time and from anywhere; and, finally, the host has remote full control of accesses.
